/* A few notes about my summer projects

In the projects to follow I will post very simple Java programs that I use to teach my students the basic 
concepts of Java. They are between 10 and 12 yrs old and this is there first time seeing the language.

They are learning things like: How to declare variables 
How to use if-then statements and do while loops.

If you have any suggestions on other projects we can do together I am open to input :)

Any other comments are also welcome.
